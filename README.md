# Heart-Disease-indicator-prediction-model

𝐈𝐧𝐭𝐫𝐨𝐝𝐮𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧:
In this analysis, I investigated the relationship between various factors such as BMI, smoking, alcohol consumption, physical and mental health, walking difficulty, sex, age, race, diabetes, physical activity, general health, sleep time, asthma, kidney disease, skin cancer, and the occurrence of heart disease.

𝐊𝐞𝐲 𝐅𝐢𝐧𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐬:
I used several machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, Random Forest, and Regularized Random Forest to predict the occurrence of heart disease based on the factors mentioned above. The Random Forest model achieved the highest accuracy score of 0.9063 on the test set, followed by the Regularized Random Forest model with an accuracy score of 0.9141. The Logistic Regression model also performed well with accuracy scores of 0.862 and 0.9153, respectively.

𝐌𝐞𝐭𝐡𝐨𝐝𝐨𝐥𝐨𝐠𝐲:
I used a dataset containing 319,795 observations and 17 features to train and test the models. We used a 70-30 train-test split and used cross-validation to tune the hyperparameters of the models. I also evaluated the performance of the models on other metrics such as 𝐩𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐢𝐬𝐢𝐨𝐧, 𝐫𝐞𝐜𝐚𝐥𝐥, 𝐚𝐧𝐝 𝐅𝟏 𝐬𝐜𝐨𝐫𝐞 to get a more complete picture of their performance.

𝐂𝐚𝐥𝐥 𝐭𝐨 𝐀𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧:
The results of this analysis suggest that factors such as BMI, smoking, alcohol consumption, physical and mental health, walking difficulty, sex, age, race, diabetes, physical activity, general health, sleep time, asthma, kidney disease, and skin cancer can have a significant impact on the occurrence of heart disease.

Furthermore, the machine learning models used in this analysis can be further improved by exploring other models or by tuning the hyperparameters of the existing models.
